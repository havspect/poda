- T-test
- Cluster Analysis 
- *Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)* 

General methods: 
- Structural equation modelling

## General Methods

Structural equation modelling is a multivariate statistical analysis technique used to analyse the complex structural relationship between measured variables and latent constructs. Usage: 


## Structure of a dataset 
### Confirmatory factor analysis
Is a multivariate statistical technique used to verify how well measured variables represent latent constructs. Usage: 

- analyse wether data fit to a hypothesized measurement model (Model for a latent variable)
- test the model structure
- test quality of model
